    " - The second assumption to consider is independence.  The dataset may not use a method such as repeated measures.  Our dataset, as far as we understand, has measured unique, independent crime activities.\n",
    " - The third assumption or requirement is that the selected data must have little or no multicollinearity among the variables.  During our Exploratory Data Analysis, we did identify that we had correlation between months and temperature data.  We did not include the weather data in this modeling.  \n",
    " - A final requirement for logistic regression is a 'large' sample size.  At an original dataset of 1.4M observations, we comfortably met this metric."
